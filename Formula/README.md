# Formula Directory

The formula directory is a mandatory directory for a [homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps).

Because pokeget doesn't meet the notability requirements to be on homebrew/core, this tap simply exists to still be able to install pokeget with homebrew.

pokeget needs <30 forks, <30 watchers and <75 stars to be able to be on homebrew/core, so if you like pokeget please star it & watch it.
